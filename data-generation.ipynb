      "The MRI reveals a lesion in the right peripheral zone, measuring 1.9 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm, with characteristics suggestive of prostate cancer. The lesion, noted in the record of patient [PATIENT_NAME] (D.O.B. 12/10/1970), shows a markedly hypointense signal on T2-weighted images and increased signal intensity on the DWI sequences. The corresponding ADC map highlights low ADC values, typical for malignant lesions. Serum PSA was reported at 17.32 ng/ml on 02/15/2024, an increase from previous levels noted in [PATIENT_NAME]'s records. There is no evidence of extraprostatic extension or seminal vesicle involvement. The lymph nodes and adjacent structures are within normal limits, with no signs of metastasis identified. The tumor is not associated with an acute cancer. The tumor is more likely to have metastatic progression in the brain.  CONCLUSIONS:  The present data show that prostate cancer is a major risk factor for a wide range of diseases.\n",

      "A concerning lesion measuring 2.8 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm is observed in the anterior fibromuscular stroma of the prostate, [PATIENT_NAME] 07/24/1968 exhibits a hypointense signal on T2-weighted images and pronounced enhancement post-contrast. The lesion demonstrates restricted diffusion on DWI, and the ADC map shows low ADC values, suggestive of malignancy. No sign of extracapsular extension is detected.

      "The MRI scan identified a post-treatment residual lesion in the prostate's left hemisphere, measuring 1.6 x 2.1 x 1.8 cm. This lesion, associated with patient [PATIENT_NAME]] (D.O.B. 06/11/1972), [ADDRESS], demonstrated characteristics suggestive of persistent cancerous tissue, including hypointensity on T2-weighted sequences and elevated signal intensity on DCE-MRI. The DWI sequence, alongside the ADC map, indicated restricted diffusion within the lesion. The serum PSA level as of 04/15/2024 was 13.45 ng/ml, reflecting a decrease from prior measurements. No evidence of metastasis to lymph nodes or distant organs was observed. The bladder and seminal vesicles appeared normal, with no signs of invasion. The blood pressure was normal. The left ventricle of the prostate was normal and was in a normal state. There was no evidence of metastasis to lymph nodes. The urine level of the prostate was normal. There was no evidence of metastasis\n",
